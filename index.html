		Console <br>
The console is a panel that displays important messages, like errors, for developers. Much of the work the computer does with our code is invisible to us by default. If we want to see things appear on our screen, we can print, or log, to our console directly.
	</p>

	<p>
		Comments <br>
Programming is often highly collaborative. In addition, our own code can quickly become difficult to understand when we return to it— sometimes only an hour later! For these reasons, it’s often useful to leave notes in our code for other developers or ourselves.
	</p>

	<p>
		Data Types <br>
Data types are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in programming. In JavaScript, there are seven fundamental data types: Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Object, Symbol

	<p class=" text-green-900">What is the correct way to declare a new variable that you can change?</p>
	<p class="my-0">A) let myName = 'Sloan';</p>
	<p class="my-0">B) myName = 'Sloan';</p>
	<p class="my-0">C) const myName = 'Sloan';</p>
	<p class="my-0">D) let myName: 'Sloan';</p>

</div>

<p>
	Concatenation <br>
	This process of appending one string to another is called concatenation. 
</p>
<p>
	Arithmetic Operators <br>
Basic arithmetic often comes in handy when programming. An operator is a character that performs a task in our code. JavaScript has several built-in arithmetic operators, that allow us to perform mathematical calculations on numbers. These include the following operators and their corresponding symbols: Add: + Subtract: - Multiply: * Divide: / Remainder: %

Variables <br>
In programming, a variable is a container for a value. You can think of variables as little containers for information that live in a computer’s memory. Information stored in variables, such as a username, account number, or even personalized greeting can then be found in memory.
</p><p>
Create a Variable:  var<br>
There were a lot of changes introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript in 2015. One of the biggest changes was two new keywords, let and const, to create, or declare, variables. Prior to the ES6, programmers could only use the var keyword to declare variables.
